 Restaurant Waitlist App

After going to several restaurants that did not have a decent way to manage wait times for the large number of customers they serve. I decided to create a simple app for them to use.

The objective of this project is firstly to help them and also mainly for my to practice my Vanilla Javascript, GitHub and to help me get a basic understaning of the back end side of Apps.

Please feel free to give suggestions or help.
 I am always open to ideas and willing to learn more.
